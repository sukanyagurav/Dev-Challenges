## Overview
I built a "Meet the Team" section for a website as part of a design challenge. The layout features five images, each representing a team member along with their name and job title. My goal with this project is to practice using grid layout and positioning techniques, specifically position: absolute and position: relative, to create a responsive and visually appealing design.
